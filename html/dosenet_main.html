DoseNet aims to form a sensor network with schools throughout the Bay Area and beyond that will serve to establish a relationship between UC Berkeley and member high schools, with long-term goals of building students' understanding of scientific and technologic thinking while engaging and informing the community. We see interacting with young students as vital to improving community understanding of radiation and radiation risks as well as providing valuable hands-on experimentation in a relevant and cutting edge scientific endeavor. To aid in building this community, we plan to have semi-yearly workshops, bringing together students from across the network to present the results from measurements taken at their location and absorb new concepts from their scientific community.</p>

	<p>Developing this radiation sensor network will help to illustrate naturally occurring background radiation and associated temporal and spatial variations. Students can learn to complete research projects with the data they collect through the network to and use to make quantitative descriptions of their observations and the uncertainties associated with them. Through Berkeley Radwatch and the DoseNet community will provide a forum for dialogue among experts, educators, students, and ultimately the public. These sensors have the potential to give students hands-on radiation detection and environmental sources while teaching them some of the basics of scientific thinking including large statistics data analysis and interpretation involving experimental uncertainties and error analysis. </p>

	<p> Several undergraduate students have already been directly involved in the construction and interfacing. There is the potential for interested advanced high school students to continue with this development, build new models for in-class use, and upgrade them to include additional capabilities as well.</p>

	<p>This network has the potential to continue expanding across California, the US and ultimately internationally. We foresee integrating our dosimeter network, along with any future capabilities such as air quality/temperature monitoring, with other such networks already in use around the United States.</p>

	<p>These dosimeter devices are simple and cheap, containing three to four basic parts: a raspberry pi, a small dosimeter, optionally a touch screen for direct interaction, and a 3D printed case designed to accommodate these parts. The design includes the possibility to expand on these main components with additional sensors. This flexibility relies on the modularity of our python API for operating the device and the flexibility of the raspberry pi.</p>

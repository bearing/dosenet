ISSUES:

geoJSON is not updating correctly
- looks like data isn't being read correctly to find new entry
- older locations still work, but not getting newest data point

Time binning methods need speeding up: use pandas resample
- needs datatime ojbects for resampling
- looks like only quick/clean way to get this is using the epoch time column (use this method in LabMethods.py from E11)
- basically can only do the same opperation to all columns (mean, sum, etc) 
    - probably sum and manually modify this as appropriate
    - maybe mean for most data and sum for counts
- need to re-build other time columns? At least the local time as this is what we would want for web display

Raw data on website is too big
- push to somewhere else like dropbox (this is what radwatch does) and then link to that on website?
- compress data first?
- different data format?
- move back to database interface with API/query interface on website? (Longer term option, a lot of work)
